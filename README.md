Multipart MIME Parser
=====================

[Haskell][1] playground to explore [test-driven development][2] of a
[multipart MIME][3] parser. I'm working on the same thing in [F#][4] for work,
but needed a different perspective on the problem.

I'm using [HSpec][5] to develop simple tests that drive the development. I'm at
the point where I need to define a recursive type for the post, and hitting
against my Haskell limitations, embarassingly.
